# Getting started with the Terasic DE10 Nano board
This is a tutorial on how to make designs for the Terasic DE10 Nano board.

Other tutorials make heavy use of the Quartus GUI and the Platform Designer
(previously called Qsys), but I prefer to use the command line and scripting.
This is mainly a matter of preference, but I do think scripting gives more
flexibility and makes it easier to see what is happening "behind the scenes".

This tutorial is originally intended as a personal log, but I do believe it can
benefit other people that are just learning how to program their DE10 Nano
board.
